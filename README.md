# Software Pods

If you'd prefer to use your own devices, you may install the Radar Pod agent using one of the following installers:



Debian / Deb

* AMD64: https://pods.radartoolkit.com/client\_versions/stable/packages/deb-amd64/download
* ARM64: https://pods.radartoolkit.com/client\_versions/stable/packages/deb-arm64/download

Fedora / RPM

* AMD64: https://pods.radartoolkit.com/client\_versions/stable/packages/rpm-amd64/download
* ARM64: https://pods.radartoolkit.com/client\_versions/stable/packages/rpm-arm64/download

Mac

* AMD64: https://pods.radartoolkit.com/client\_versions/stable/packages/pkg-amd64/download
* ARM64 / M1: https://pods.radartoolkit.com/client\_versions/stable/packages/pkg-arm64/download

Windows

* MSI - AMD64: https://pods.radartoolkit.com/client\_versions/stable/packages/msi-amd64/download

Once setup, the agent should automatically start and create a configuration file at a location such as `/root/.config/radar/config.conf` which will contain your pod's ID which can then be used to add the pod to https://pods.radartoolkit.com
