# Pod Hardware

Our version 1 Pod hardware is based on the Raspberry Pi 4B. There are several variations of pods within the set of V1 hardware including the 2GB, 4GB, and 8GB memory versions of the Raspberry pi as well as different amounts of disk space via the SD card from 16GB to 128GB depending on the device.

As of Sept 5, 2023, the current software and hardware version use approximately 2.2 to 2.3 watts of power on average tested over a 6 day duration. This is relevant in locations where power availability / lower cost is not a given such as remote locations in Alaska.
