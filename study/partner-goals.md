# Partner Goals

The Telehealth Broadband Pilot Program aims to install monitoring devices, or "Pods," in 25 counties across 4 US states (the study area). The following goals have been set for our partner organizations that will be responsible for deploying the Pods:

1. Deploy a minimum of 25 networks per county within the study area.
2. Set-up at least 3 networks in each Designated Census Place that is either fully or partially located in the study area.
3. Attempt to deploy 3 networks per ISP-County combination. For example, if Comcast provides internet service in two counties within a given state, our goal is to set-up 6 networks at sites with Comcast, with three networks in each county.
4. Conduct mobile internet monitoring by driving 500 miles with 3 cellphones. These cellphones will be used to monitor the top 3 mobile internet service providers that construct their own cell towers, which are Verizon, AT\&T, and T-Mobile.

Networks are individual physical buildings with a unique ISP provider. Two buildings with a shared ISP would count as two networks if monitored separately. One building with two ISPs can be counted as two networks if there is are two Pods monitoring each ISP individually.

A network becomes "counted" if it is either:

1. Currently has a Pod online.
2. Has previously had 90 days of monitoring by a Pod. The Pod does not need to have been continuously online for 90 days but there must be 90 days of wall-time where a Pod was online at the network in the network's history.

These goals are intended to help us gather comprehensive data on internet performance across the study area, and to identify any areas where service may be lacking or in need of improvement. We appreciate the efforts of our partner organizations in helping us achieve these goals.
