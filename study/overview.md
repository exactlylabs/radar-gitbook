# Overview

The Radar Toolkit has been created to satisfy the needs of the Telehealth Broadband Pilot Program. The primary goal of this work is to gather data to help better understand broadband internet access in rural communities across America with a focus on health and telehealth related issues.

The Telehealth Broadband Pilot Program is made possible by grant #GA540183 from the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth, Health Resources and Services Administration, DHHS.
